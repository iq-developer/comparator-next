# Copmarator Widget

## My assumptions

I prefer techologies that are already used in you project.
So I selected:

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML/CSS (Tailwind)
- React (you also have Next, so I move code to Next.js)
- Git (with Github)
- Animation library (Motion.dev)

You doesn't have responsive design, and so did I

- width: 700px
- height: 600px

## Note

bottom and top id are switched because of col-reverse

## To run the project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
